# Installation

## General Information

### Minimum requirements

#### Hardware / OS

A fresh linux VM running either Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Debian 10 with 3GB RAM

!!!warning
    The provided install script assumes a fresh server with no software installed on it. Attempting to run it on an existing server with other services **will** break things and the install will fail.

!!!note
    The install script has been tested on the following public cloud providers: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as behind NAT on Hyper-V, Proxmox and ESXi.

#### Network Requirements

- A real (internet resolvable) domain is needed to generate a Let's Encrypt wildcard cert. _If you cannot afford to purchase a domain ($12 a year) then you can get one for free at [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com/)_
    - example.local is __NOT__ a real domain. No you [don't have to expose your server](faq.md#can-i-run-tactical-rmm-locally-behind-nat-without-exposing-anything-to-the-internet) to the internet
- A TOTP based authenticator app. Some popular ones are Google Authenticator, Authy and Microsoft Authenticator.

#### Update Recommendations

!!!note
    We highly recommend staying current with updates (at least every 3 months when you update your SSL certs is a good minimum) while Tactical RMM is still working towards its 1.0 release.<br/><br/>
    Until we reach production release, there may be architectural changes that may be made to Tactical RMM and only a regular patching schedule is supported by developers.

## Option 1: Easy Install on a VPS

Install on a VPS: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure to name a few

Use something that meets [minimum specs](install_server.md#hardware-os)

### Run updates and setup the linux user

SSH into the server as **root**.

Download and run the prereqs and latest updates

```bash
apt update
apt install -y wget curl sudo
apt -y upgrade
```

If a new kernel is installed, then reboot the server with the `reboot` command

Create a linux user named `tactical` to run the rmm and add it to the sudoers group.

**For Ubuntu**:

```bash
adduser tactical
usermod -a -G sudo tactical
```

**For Debian**:

```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash tactical
usermod -a -G sudo tactical
```

!!!tip
    [Enable passwordless sudo to make your life easier](https://linuxconfig.org/configure-sudo-without-password-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux)

### Setup the firewall (optional but highly recommended)

!!!info
    Skip this step if your VM is __not__ publicly exposed to the world e.g. running behind NAT. You should setup the firewall rules in your router instead (ports 22, 443 and 4222 TCP).

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow https
ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 4222
```

!!!info
    SSH (port 22 tcp) is only required for you to remotely login and do basic linux server administration for your rmm. It is not needed for any agent communication.<br/>
Allow ssh from everywhere (__not__ recommended)

```bash
ufw allow ssh
```

Allow ssh from only allowed IP's (__highly__ recommended)

```bash
ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
```

Enable and activate the firewall

```bash
ufw enable && ufw reload
```

### Create the A records

We'll be using `example.com` as our domain for this example.

!!!info
    The RMM uses 3 different sites. The Vue frontend e.g. `rmm.example.com` which is where you'll be accesing your RMM from the browser, the REST backend e.g. `api.example.com` and Meshcentral e.g. `mesh.example.com`

1. Get the public IP of your server with `curl https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io`
2. Open the DNS manager of wherever the domain you purchased is hosted.
3. Create 3 A records: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh` and point them to the public IP of your server:

### Run the install script

Switch to the `tactical` user

```bash
su - tactical
```

Download and run the install script

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Answer the initial questions when prompted. Replace `example.com` with your domain.

### Deploy the TXT record in your DNS manager for Lets Encrypt wildcard certs

!!!warning
    TXT records can take anywhere from 1 minute to a few hours to propogate depending on your DNS provider.<br/>
    You should verify the TXT record has been deployed first before pressing Enter.<br/>
    A quick way to check is with the following command:<br/> `dig -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com`<br/>
    or test using: <https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/> Enter: `_acme-challenge.example.com`

![txtrecord](images/txtrecord.png)

![dnstxt](images/dnstxt.png)

Create a login for the RMM web UI:

![rmmlogin](images/rmmlogin.png)

A bunch of URLS / usernames / passwords will be printed out at the end of the install script. **Save these somewhere safe.** [Recover them if you didn't](faq.md#how-do-i-recover-my-meshcentral-login-credentials)

### Upload mesh agents

Copy the url for the meshagent exe (`https://mesh.example.com/agentinvite?c=......`), paste it in your browser and download the mesh agent:

![meshagentdl](images/meshagentdl.png)

Navigate to `https://rmm.example.com` and login with the username/password you created during install.

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the initial setup page.

Create your first client/site, choose the default timezone and then upload the mesh agent you just downloaded.

### You're Done

[Update Regularly](install_server.md#update-regularly)

## Option 2: Install behind NAT Router

Install in your local network using: Dedicated hardware, Hyper-V, Proxmox or ESXi. All been tested and work fine.

Do everything from [Option 1: Easy Install](install_server.md#run-updates-and-setup-the-linux-user)

### If you only have agents on the private network/subnet

Make sure your local DNS server (or agents hosts file) have your Tactical RMM server IP addresses for the 3 domain names: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh`

### Agents exist outside the private network/subnet - Setup Port Forwarding

If you have agents outside your local network: Make sure the public DNS servers have A records for the 3 Tactical RMM server domain names: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh`

Login to your router/NAT device.

1. Set your TRMM server as a static IP (Use a DHCP reservation is usually safer)
2. Create 2 port forwarding rules. `TCP Port 443` and `TCP Port 4222` to your TRMM servers private IP address.
   
!!!note
    <https://portforward.com/> can help with Port Forwarding setup

### You're Done

[Update Regularly](install_server.md#update-regularly)

## Option 3: Installs by Network Wizards

Use the scripts above.

### Requirements

1. TLD domain name which is internet resolvable (this is for a LetsEncrypt DNS wildcard request during the install script [validated by DNS txt record](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)).
    - Test using: <https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/> or <https://dnschecker.org/>. Enter: `_acme-challenge.example.com` as `TXT`
2. Agents need to be able to connect to your server via DNS lookup (hosts file, local DNS, smoke signals etc.).
    - Test from agent: `ping rmm.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server
    - Test from agent: `ping api.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server
    - Test from agent: `ping mesh.example.com`. Should result in the IP of your Tactical RMM server

!!!note
    Did you notice #2 doesn't need to be something publicly available?

That's it. You're a wizard, you know how to satisfy these 2 items.

You'll probably enjoy browsing thru the [Unsupported section](unsupported_guidelines.md) of the docs.

## Update Regularly

We've said it before, we'll say it again.

- We recommend regular updates.

    - Every 3 months.

        - Do it when you update your SSL certs.
