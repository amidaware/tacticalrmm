## Server Troubleshooting Script

If you've asked for help in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/736478043522072608/744282073870630912) please run this, and send a screenshot at the top of the thread created for troubleshooting your issue.

Blur your domains if you desire privacy.

```bash
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/master/troubleshoot_server.sh
chmod +x troubleshoot_server.sh
./troubleshoot_server.sh
```

## Make sure DNS (name resolution) was setup properly

### From the agent

Open command prompt

```cmd
ping rmm.example.com
ping api.example.com
ping mesh.example.com
```

The IP address for all 3 should reflect your Tactical RMM server

## Problems after new server install

In the very unlikely event you have issues after install please wipe the box and install again (following all the steps including downloading the install script _but not running it yet_) use the following command which will log the install progress and if you continue to have issues will assist with support of the installation.

```bash
bash -x install.sh 2>&1 | tee install.log
```

!!!note
    Logging of installs isn’t desirable as it logs extremely sensitive information which is why this isn’t done by default! **Do not** post the raw log publicly only provide it if requested and then by dm only.

## "Bad credentials" error when trying to login to the Web UI

If you are sure you are using the correct credentials and still getting a "bad credentials" error, open your browser's dev tools (++ctrl+shift+j++ on chrome) and check the Console tab to see the real error.

It will most probably be a CORS error which means you need to check your DNS settings and make sure whatever computer you're trying to access the UI from resolves your 3 subdomains to the correct IP of the server running the RMM (public IP if running in the cloud, or private IP if running behind NAT).

If you see an error about SSL or certificate expired, then your Let's Encrypt cert has probably expired and you'll need to renew it.

Refer to the Let's Encrypt cert renewal instructions [here](update_server.md#keeping-your-lets-encrypt-certificate-up-to-date)

## Agents not installing or updating

The most common problem we've seen of agents not installing or updating is due to Antivirus blocking the updater executable.

Windows Defender will 100% of the time block the updater from running unless an exclusion is set.

Refer to the [Agent Installation](install_agent.md) instructions for AV exceptions to set and manually doing an agent update with logging to troubleshoot further.

Agents will also not automatically update if they are too old.

Since Tactical RMM is still in alpha and the developers makes breaking changes pretty frequently, there is no promise of backwards compatibility.

If you have agents that are relatively old, you will need to uninstall them manually and reinstall using the latest version.

## Agents not checking in or showing up / General agent issues

These are nats problems. Try quickfix first:

### from Admin Web Interface

First, reload NATS from tactical's web UI:<br>
*Tools > Server Maintenance > Reload Nats Configuration*

If that doesn't work, check each part starting with the server:

### Server SSH login

Reload NATS:

```bash
/rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py reload_nats
sudo systemctl restart nats
```

Look at nats service errors (make sure it's running)

```bash
sudo systemctl status nats
```

If nats isn't running see detailed reason why it isn't:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nats
nats-server -DVV -c /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/nats-rmm.conf
```

Fix the problem, then restart nats.
```
sudo systemctl restart nats
```

### From Agent Install

Open CMD as admin on the problem computer and stop the agent services:

```cmd
net stop tacticalagent
net stop tacticalrpc
```

Run the tacticalagent service manually with debug logging:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m winagentsvc -log debug -logto stdout
```

Run the tacticalrpc service manually with debug logging:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m rpc -log debug -logto stdout
```

This will print out a ton of info. You should be able to see the error from the debug log output.

Please then copy/paste the logs and post them either in our [Discord support chat](https://discord.gg/upGTkWp), or create a [github issue](https://github.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/issues).

If all else fails, simply uninstall the agent either from control panel or silently with `"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\unins000.exe" /VERYSILENT` and then reinstall the agent.

## All other errors

First, run the [update script](update_server.md#updating-to-the-latest-rmm-version) with the `--force` flag.

This will fix permissions and reinstall python/node packages that might have gotten corrupted.

```bash
./update.sh --force
```

Check the debug log from the web UI: **File > Debug Log**

Open your browser's dev tools (++ctrl+shift+j++ on chrome) and check the Console tab for any errors

Check all the systemd services that the rmm uses to function and check to make sure they're all active/running and enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl status rmm
sudo systemctl status daphne
sudo systemctl status celery
sudo systemctl status celerybeat
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl status nats
sudo systemctl status nats-api
sudo systemctl status meshcentral
sudo systemctl status mongod
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo systemctl status redis
```

Read through the log files in the following folders and check for errors:

```bash
/rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log
/var/log/celery
```

## Using Cloudflare DNS

- rmm.example.com can be proxied.

- api.example.com can NOT be proxied.

- mesh.example.com can be proxied with the caveat that Mesh checks the cert presented to the agent is the same one on the server. I.e. no MITM. You'll need to copy Cloudflare's edge cert to your server if you want to proxy this domain.

## Testing Network Connectivity between agent and server

Use powershell, make sure you can connect to 443 and 4222 from agent to server:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName api.example.com -Port 4222
```

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName api.example.com -Port 443
```

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName rmm.example.com -Port 443
```

Are you trying to use a proxy to share your single public IP with multiple services on 443? This is complicated and [unsupported by Tactical RMM](unsupported_scripts.md), test your setup.

## Mesh Agent x86 x64 integration with TRMM

1. Log into Mesh (you can right-click any agent, choose remote control or Remote Background)
2. Goto your mesh interface (eg `https://mesh.EXAMPLE.COM`) 
3. Find your TacticalRMM group
4. Click the add link
5. Download both agents
6. In Tactical RMM, go **Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral > Upload Mesh Agents** upload them both into the appropriate places.

## Need to recover your mesh token?

Login to server with SSH and run:

```bash
node /meshcentral/node_modules/meshcentral --logintokenkey
```

## Mesh Agent Not Connecting to server

When agents don't show up in your mesh console (after logging into https://mesh.EXAMPLE.COM), and all data is blank. Your AV has most likely blocked the agent.
