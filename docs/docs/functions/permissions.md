# User Roles and Permissions

## Permission Manager

Make sure you've setup at least 1 valid (Super User aka Administrator) role under _Settings > Permission Manager_

1. Login as usual Tactical user
2. Go to Settings - Permissions Manager
3. Click New Role
4. You can all the role anything, I called it Admins
5. Tick the Super User Box/or relevant permissions required
6. Click Save then exit Permissions Manager
7. Go to Settings - Users
8. Open current logged in user/or any other user and assign role (created above step 6) in the Role drop down box.
9. Click Save 

Once you've set that up a Super User role and assigned your primary user, you can create other Roles with more limited access.
